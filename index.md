CODECHECK tackles one of the main challenges of computational research by supporting codecheckers with a workflow, guidelines and tools to evaluate computer programs underlying scientific papers.
The independent time-stamped runs conducted by codecheckers will award a _"certificate of executable computation"_ and increase availability, discovery and reproducibility of crucial artefacts for computational sciences.
See [**the CODECHECK paper**](#2021-07--f1000research-paper-on-codecheck-published-after-reviews-) for a full description of problems, solutions, and goals and take a look at the [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/codecheckers) for examples of codechecks and the CODECHECK infrastructure and tools.

CODECHECK is based on **five principles** which are described in detail in the [project description](/project) and [the paper](#2021-07--f1000research-paper-on-codecheck-published-after-reviews-).

1. Codecheckers record but don't investigate or fix.
1. Communication between humans is key.
1. Credit is given to codecheckers.
1. Workflows must be auditable.
1. Open by default and transitional by disposition.

The principles can be implemented in different [processes](/process/), one of which is the [CODECHECK community workflow](/guide/community-workflow-overview).
**If you want to get involved as a codechecker in the community, or if you want to apply the CODECHECK principles in your journal or conference, please take a look at the [Get Involved](/get-involved) page.**

### 2024-11 | CODECHECK at ASSA summer school in Eindhoven üîâ

On the last day of the üçÅ [Autumn School Series in Acoustics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/assaeindhoven/) at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/), the autum school team of [Maarten Hornikx](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maartenhornikx/) and [Huiqing Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huiqing-wang-2596544a/) organized a track on _open research software in the computational acoustics_.

This day is part of the [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en/) (Dutch Research Council) open science fund project [_Unlocking the impact potential of research software in acoustics_](https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/osf231057), driven by the [TU/e Building Acoustics](https://building-acoustics.net/) team, which targets to to foster a culture change regarding good practices in open science regarding the development and dissemination of research software in acoustics.
After a successful workshop in [Nantes](https://lnkd.in/em5HDJ6m), the team now targeted early career researchers.

The day kicked off with talks about the potential and future of open research software, best practices in open research software, and instructions and guidelines for acceleration of sharing research software, by Maarten and Huiqing.

One particular aspect of research software is related to reproducible research.
In the afternoon, participants carried out a CODECHECK process, targeting the independent execution of computations underlying research articles.
While the purpose of the afternoon was to experience running open research software developed by colleagues and getting experience with the process of codecheck, we have had great discussions on what we need in our community to bring research software further for the sake of quality, reproducibility, collaboration and impact of research.

Outcomes of this workshop and the previous workshop will be shared, such that we indeed can take the right step forward in our community!

üôèüèª Thanks to Frank Ostermann, Daniel N√ºst and Daniela Gawehns for the support from CODECHECK!

### 2021-04 | CODECHECK @ ITC ‚úÖ

CODECHECK supporter [Markus Konkol](https://twitter.com/MarkusKonkol) has built a CODECHECK process for all researchers at the University of Twente's Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation ([ITC](https://www.itc.nl)).
He offers his expertise to codecheck manuscripts and underlying source code and data before submission or preprint publication, so even if the information is still not publicly shared.
His reports will then go public on Zenodo when the paper comes out, just like a regular CODECHECK, and can support the article's claims.
If timed right, authors can even link to the certificate before submission.
_This is a great service for ITC researchers and their reviewers and readers!_

Learn more at **<https://www.itc.nl/research/open-science/codecheck/>** and see an example at <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5106408>.
