# Introduction

The CODECHECK process describes a workflow for a reproduction of computations as part of a scientific peer review.
CODECHECK follows a set of [principles](/) that allow many different variations into [concrete implementations](/process).
The requirements for a successful CODECHECK are intentionally kept to a minimum, as are the requirements on how codechecking is conducted, or how the procedure is documented.
At the end of the CODECHECK stands a CODECHECK report document, written by the codechecker and understandable to a person with some expertise in the scientific field of the related article.
Besides the human-readable information in the CODECHEK report, there is a small set of metadata elements that are part of a CODECHECK procedure which are worth capturing in a more structured format.

This metadata is saved in the CODECHECK configuration file, which is specified in this document in version {{ page.version }}.
The CODECHECK configuration file can serve as the identifier of a [CODECHECK bundle]({{ '/bundle' | absolute_url }}), i.e. all the files part of a CODECHECK.
The CODECHEK bundle is _not_ formally specified, as its contents are largely at the discretion of the codechecker.
The CODECHECK configuration file, however, is formally specified to enable automated extraction and development of tools to support codechecking.
Both the author and the codechecker contribute information to the configuration file.

In the future, this information enables both meta-research about code within peer-reviews and more user-friendly assitance systems for authors, codecheckers, and publisher's staff.

# tl;dr for authors

If you are an _author_ and just want to get the minimal `codecheck.yml` file prepared to the [community review process]({{ 'guide/community-process' | absolute_url }}) [without reading the whole technical specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read), then please use the following template.
The template has a bit more than the strictly mandatory fields, but these extra fields are important for you as a creator to get credit.
Please validate your final configuration file with a [YAML Validator](https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator).

~~~yaml

# Format, name and encoding

Format: [YAML 1.1](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/spec.html) _or later_

Name: **`codecheck.yml`**

The file MUST be encoded in UTF-8.

# Versioning

This document specifies version `{{ page.version }}`.
The specification uses a `major.minor` semantic versioning scheme.
Non-breaking changes can be introduced in a minor version release.
The latest version of the specification can be found at [{{ '/spec/config/latest' | absolute_url }}]({{ '/spec/config/latest' | absolute_url }}).

# Storage location

The `codecheck.yml` is stored at the root of the project folder where all files related to the CODECHECK are saved.
The folder where the `codecheck.yml` file is stored is called the _CODECHECK bundle_.
It is the folder that also includes a directory `codecheck` (or `.codecheck`) for all files created during codechecking, see [CODECHECK bundle documentation]({{ '/bundle' | absolute_url }}).

# Content

## Explicit document and directive

The file MUST include three dashes (`---`), the document start marker, to seperate the directive from document content.

The file SHOULD define the YAML version in the directive.
While YAML supports [bare](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2800132) (YAML 1.2)/[implicit](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#id898031) (YAML 1.1) documents, an explicit indication of the format is preferable for the CODECHECK use case.
A `codecheck.yml` file is therefore an _explicit document_.

## Version

The file SHOULD include a root-level node `version` with a URL denoting the used version of the CODECHECK configuration file specification.
If no version is provided, the [latest version]({{ '/spec/config/latest' | absolute_url }}) SHOULD be assumed by software tools, but these tools CAN also abort processing the `codecheck.yml` with an informative message.

> Example
> 
> ~~~yaml
> %YAML 1.1
> ---
> version: {{ page.url | absolute_url }}
> ~~~

## Manifest list

The configuration file MUST have a root-level sequence (i.e., a list) of files called `manifest` that form the _manifest_.
All files part of the manifest must be recreated during a CODECHECK.

Each manifest sequence item MUST have a node `file` providing the relative path to a file that is part of the computational workflow.
The relative paths MUST be relative to the location of the `codecheck.yml`.
Each manifest sequence item MAY have a node `comment` with human-readable information about said file.

> Example
> 
> ~~~yaml
> ---
> version: {{ page.url | absolute_url }}
> 
> manifest:
>   - file: outputData.csv
>     comment: data/output/one.csv
>   - file: fig1.pdf
>   - file: resultVectors.txt
>   - file: appendix_figures.pdf
>     comment: "appendix of paper, starting at page 12"
> ~~~

## Author and submission metadata

The configuration file SHOULD include minimal metadata about the paper, i.e. the title and the author(s) of the paper whose workflow is submitted to the CODECHECK.
For this information, the configuration file SHOULD have a root-level sequence `paper`.
This information might be added after the CODECHECK or edited, e.g., after publication, therefore all sub-elements are optional.

The element `paper` SHOULD have a child item `title` with the title of the submission or publication.

The element `paper` SHOULD have a child sequence `authors`.
The child nodes of `authors` sequence are called "author item".
There MUST be at least one author item, which is the corresponding author of the workflow under review.
The corresponding author MUST be the first author item in the `authors` sequence.
However, "authors" may be used very broadly and should not only list all authors but can include all types of contributors, e.g., software engineers, infrastructure service staff, etc.

Each author item MUST have a child  `name` with the author's name.
Each author item SHOULD have a child `ORCID` with the author's [ORCID identifier](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006897674).
The value of the MUST can be the plain ORCID, e.g., `0000-0000-0000-0000`, without URL prefix (i.e., without `https://orcid.org/...`).

If the workflow accompanies a preprinted article or concerns an article under review, a reference to the article SHOULD be put in the node `reference` under the root-level node `paper`.
Ideally the identifier is a [DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) in form of a resolvable URL, or a identifiable text string such as `arXiv:2001.10641`, or a short text "Under review at X"/"Paper to appear in Y".

> Example
> 
> ~~~yaml
> ---
> # [...]
>
> paper:
>   title: "A good paper"
>   authors:
>     - name: Josiah Carberry
>       ORCID: 0000-0002-1825-0097
>     - name: John Doe
>   reference: https://doi.org/preprint.1
> ~~~

<a name='source'>

The configuration file CAN have a root level node `source` with a textual description or a single URL to describe the source of the checked material.
The field MUST be used if the material used for the check is drawn from multiple sources so that the `repository` node (see [Codecheck metadata](#codecheck-metadata)) and the metadata accessible via that URL can not sufficiently describe provenance of code or data files.

> Example
> 
> ~~~yaml
> ---
> # [...]
>
> source: Data is available at https://download.url/dataset/123456/v2 and code can be found in an attachment to the submitted manuscript.
> ~~~

## Codecheck metadata

Further important metadata is created during the CODECHECK process.
The `codecheck.yml` started by the author is extended with this information by the codechecker.
If a codechecker changes the meaning of any content provided by the author in the configuration file, they SHOULD clearly mark these changes in the form of a comment, in addition to a transparent record through the file being under version control.

The configuration file MUST include minimal metadata about the codechecker in a root-level sequence `codechecker` with at least one child element.
Each item in the `codechecker` sequence MUST have one node `name` with the codechecker's name.
Each item in the `codechecker` sequence SHOULD have a child `ORCID` as defined in [Author and submission metadata](#author-and-submission-metadata).

The configuration file MUST have a root-level node `report` with a unique identifier for the published CODECHECK report, such as a URL or DOI, ideally in a resolvable format.

The CODECHECK CAN add further fields with the following names and semantics:

- `summary`: Short textual summary of the CODECHECK report.
- `repository`: A URL to the code repository where more files and a version history of the checked workflow are available.
- `source`: see [`source`](#source).
- `check_time`: A date or timestamp when the CODECHECK was completed. If not time is provided, it should be assumed that codechecking was completed at the publication date of the CODECHEK report.
- `certificate`: A unique identifier for the certificate as awared in the [CODECHECK register](https://github.com/codecheckers/register/).

## Additional content

The file `codecheck.yml` may include any number of other nodes or sequences to support specific instances of a CODECHECK process.
For clarity these SHOULD be named in a way that clearly identifies the origin and use case, e.g. by prepending a common prefix to node names or using a single parent node.
