# Introduction

The CODE CHECK process describes a workflow for a reproduction of computations as part of a scientific peer review.
CODE CHECK follows a set of [principles](/) that allow many different variations into [concrete implementations](/process).
The requirements for a successful check are intentionally kept to a minimum, as are the requirements on how a check is conducted or how it is documented.
At the end of the check stands mainly a CODE CHECK report document, written by the codechecker and understandable to any human reader.
Besides the human-readable information in the report, there is a small set of metadata elements that are part of a CODE CHECK procedure which are worth capturing in a more structured format.

This metadata is saved in the CODE CHECK configuration file, which is specified in this document in version {{ page.version }}.
The CODE CHECK configuration file can serve as the identifier of a [CODE CHECK bundle]({{ '/bundle' | absolute_url }}), i.e. all the files part of a check.
The bundle is _not_ formally specified, as its contents are largely at the discretion of the codechecker.
The CODE CHECK configuration file, however, is formally specified to enable automated extraction and development of tools to support a check.
Both the author and the codechecker contribute information to the configuration file.

In the future, this information enables both meta-research about code within peer-reviews and more user-friendly assitance systems for authors, codecheckers, and publisher's staff.

> Notational conventions
>
> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

# Format, name and encoding

Format: [YAML 1.1](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/spec.html) _or later_

Name: **`codecheck.yml`**

The file MUST be encoded in UTF-8.

# Versioning

This document specifies version `{{ page.version }}`.
The specification uses a `major.minor` semantic versioning scheme.
Non-breaking changes can be introduced in a minor version release.
The latest version of the specification can be found at [{{ '/spec/config/latest' | absolute_url }}]({{ '/spec/config/latest' | absolute_url }}).

# Storage location

The `codecheck.yml` is stored at the root of the project folder where all files related to the check are saved.
The folder where the `codecheck.yml` file is stored is called the _CODE CHECK bundle_.
It is the folder that also includes a directory `codecheck` (or `.codecheck`) for all files created during a check by the codechecker, see [CODE CHECK bundle documentation]({{ '/bundle' | absolute_url }}).

# Content

## Explicit document and directive

The file MUST include three dashes (`---`), the document start marker, to seperate the directive from document content.

The file SHOULD define the YAML version in the directive.
While YAML supports [bare](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2800132)/[implicit](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#id898031) documents, an explicit indication of the format is preferable for the CODE CHECK use case.
A `codecheck.yml` file is therefore an _explicit document_.

## Version

The file SHOULD include a root-level node `version` with a URL denoting the used version of the CODE CHECK configuration file specification.
If no version is provided, the [latest version]({{ '/spec/config/latest' | absolute_url }}) SHOULD be assumed by software tools, but these tools CAN also abort processing the `codecheck.yml` with an informative message.

> Example
> 
> ~~~yaml
> %YAML 1.2
> ---
> version: {{ page.url | absolute_url }}
> ~~~

## Manifest list

The configuration file MUST have a root-level sequence (i.e., a list) of files called `manifest` that form the _manifest_.
All files part of the manifest must be recreated during a check.

Each manifest sequence item MUST have a node `file` providing the relative path to a file that is part of the computational workflow.
The relative paths MUST be relative to the location of the `codecheck.yml`.
Each manifest sequence item MAY have a node `comment` with human-readable information about said file.

> Example
> 
> ~~~yaml
> ---
> version: https://codecheck.org.uk/spec/1.0
> 
> manifest:
>   - file: outputData.csv
>     comment: data/output/one.csv
>   - file: fig1.pdf
>   - file: resultVectors.txt
>   - file: appendix_figures.pdf
>     comment: "appendix of paper, starting at page 12"
> ~~~

## Author and submission metadata

The configuration file SHOULD include minimal metadata about the authors, contributors, and other involved parties of the paper/workflow that is submitted to the check within a root-level sequence `authors`.

Each item in the `authors` sequence MUST have one child node `name` with the author's name.

Each item in the `authors` sequence SHOULD have a child `ORCID` with the [ORCID identifier](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006897674).
The value of the node can be the plain ORCID or the ORCID URL in a resolvable form.

If the workflow accompanies a preprinted article, the preprint identifier SHOULD be put in the root-level node `manuscript`.
Ideally the identifier is a [DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) in form of a resolvable URL, or a identifiable identifier such as `arXiv:2001.10641`.

> Example
> 
> ~~~yaml
> ---
> # [...]
>
> authors:
>   - name: Josiah Carberry
>     ORCID: 0000-0002-1825-0097
>   - name: John Doe
> 
> manuscript: https://doi.org/preprint.1
> ~~~

## Codecheck metadata

Further important metadata is created during the check process.
The `codecheck.yml` created by the author is extended with this information by the codechecker.
YAML allows concatenation of documents in a single file, which is used to separate the content contributed by the authors and codecheckers.
If a codechecker changes the meaning of any content provided by the author, they SHOULD clearly mark these changes in the form of a comment unless a transparent record is enabled through the file being under version control.

The configuration file content added by the codechecker MUST be separated from the author-contributed metadata with a directives end marker line, i.e., `---`.

The configuration file MUST include minimal metadata about the codechecker in a root-level node `codechecker`
The `codechecker` node MUST have one child node `name` with the codecheckers's name.
The `codechecker` node SHOULD have a child `ORCID` as defined in [Author and submission metadata](#author-and-submission-metadata).

The configuration file MUST have a root-level node `report` with a unique identifier for the published CODE CHECK report, such as a URL or DOI, ideally in a resolvable format.

The codecheck CAN add further fields with the following semantics:

- `summary`: Short textual summary of the check report.
- `repository`: A URL to the code repository where more files and a version history of the checked workflow are available.
- `check_time`: A date or timestamp when the check was completed. If not time is provided, it should be assumed that check was completed at the publication date of the report.

> ~~~yaml

> manifest:
>   - file: outputData.csv

>   - file: fig1.pdf

## Additional content

The file `codecheck.yml` may include any number of other nodes or sequences to support specific instances of a CODE CHECK process.
For clarity these SHOULD be named in a way that clearly identifies the origin and use case, e.g. by prepending a common prefix to node names or using a single parent node.

    The check was straightforward as all material was provided and documented well, but computations took about 3 hours to run.
    
    The created figures seem to match the ones provided in the article. The content of other output files was not checked.
