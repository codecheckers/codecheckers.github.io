# Introduction

The CODE CHECK process describes a workflow for a reproduction of computations as part of a scientific peer review.
CODE CHECK follows a set of [principles](/) that allow many different variations into [concrete implementations](/process).
The requirements for a successful check are intentionally kept to a minimum, as are the requirements on how a check is conducted or how it is documented.
At the end of the check stands mainly a CODE CHECK report document, written by the codechecker and understandable to any human reader.
Besides the human-readable information, there is a small set of metadata elements that are part of a CODE CHECK procedure which are worth capturing in a more structured format.

This metadata is saved in the CODE CHECK configuration file, which is specified in this document in version {{ page.version }}.
The CODE CHECK configuration file can serve as the identifier of a [CODE CHECK bundle](), i.e. all the files part of a check.
The bundle is _not_ formally specified, as its contents are largely at the discretion of the codechecker.
The CODE CHECK configuration file, however, is formally specified to enable automated extraction and development of tools to support a check.
We hope that in the future, this information enables both meta-research about code within peer-reviews and more user-friendly assitance systems for authors, codecheckers, and publisher's staff.

> Notational conventions
>
> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

# Format, name and encoding

Format: [YAML 1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)

Name: **`codecheck.yml`**

The file MUST be encoded in UTF-8.

# Versioning

This document specifies version `{{ page.version }}`.
The specification uses a `major.minor` semantic versioning scheme.
Non-breaking changes can be introduced in a minor version release.
The latest version of the specification can be found at [{{ '/spec/config/latest' | absolute_url }}]({{ '/spec/config/latest' | absolute_url }}).

# Storage location

The `codecheck.yml` is stored at the root of the project folder where all files related to the check are saved.
The folder where the `codecheck.yml` file is stored is call the _CODE CHECK bundle_, which also includes a directory `codecheck` (or `.codecheck`), see [CODE CHECK bundle documentation]().

# Content

## Directive

The file MUST include three dashes (`---`) to seperate the directive from document content.
The file SHOULD define the YAML version in the directive.

> Example
> 
> ~~~yaml
> %YAML 1.2
> ---
> ~~~

## Version

The file SHOULD include a root-level node `version` with a URL denoting the used version of this specification.

> Example
> 
> ~~~yaml
> %YAML 1.2
> ---
> version: {{ page.url | absolute_url }}
> ~~~

## Manifest list

The configuration file MUST have a root-level sequence (i.e., a list) of files called `manifest` that form the _manifest_.
All files part of the manifest must be recreated during a check.

Each manifest sequence item MUST have a node `file` providing the relative path to a file that is part of the computational workflow.
The relative paths MUST be relative to the location of the `codecheck.yml`.
Each manifest sequence item MAY have a node `comment` with human-readable information about said file.

> Example
> 
> ~~~yaml
> %YAML 1.2
> ---
> version: https://codecheck.org.uk/spec/1
> 
> manifest:
>   - file: outputData.csv
>     comment: data/output/one.csv
>   - file: fig1.pdf
>   - file: resultVectors.txt
>   - file: overview.pdf
>     comment: appendix of paper, page 12

  notes: |
    The check was straightforward as all material was provided and documented well, but computations took about 3 hours to run.
