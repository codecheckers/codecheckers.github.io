The [CODECHECK principles](/) can be implemented in different ways.
A detailed description of a generic workflow (see Figure&nbsp;2 below), a discussion of alternatives across a number of dimensions (_who_ does the check _when_ and with what _openness_ and _importance_ - see Figure&nbsp;3 below), and a review of the different involved stakeholders and roles can be found in the **[CODECHECK paper at F1000Research](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.51738.1)**.

One specific workflow is the **[CODECHECK community workflow]({{ '/guide/community-workflow-overview' | absolute_url }})**, which is used by the CODECHECK [team]({{ '/partners/#team' | absolute_url }}) to conduct checks for preprints or submitted manuscripts **independent from journal collaborations**.

Do you have ideas about how a CODECHECK workflow could work for your journal or conference? [_Let us know!_](/get-involved)
