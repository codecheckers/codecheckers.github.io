CODECHECK is a collaboration project lead by Stephen Eglen and Daniel N端st together with [a community of codecheckers](/get-involved) and external partners in the scientific, publishing, and scholarly infrastructure communities.

## Stephen Eglen (PI)

Stephen Eglen is a reader in Computational Neuroscience at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).
He has over 20 years experience as a researcher in Computational Neuroscience, and has worked on several projects encouraging more code and data sharing in Neuroscience.
Most recently this led to a trial project with the journal [Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4579), and our guidelines for sharing in [Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4550).
Stephen is also a fellow of the Alan Turing Institute ([ATI](https://www.turing.ac.uk/)), based in the British Library, and a member of the [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility](https://incf.org) which will provide logistical support e.g. on supercompute infrastructure.

Stephen will contribute his domain-specific expertise in computational neuroscience.

## Daniel N端st (Co-PI)

Daniel N端st is researcher and open source software developer at the Institute for Geoinformatics ([ifgi](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/)), University of M端nster.
In the project _Opening Reproducible Research_ ([o2r](https://o2r.info)) he develops new specifications and tools to support scientists in working more reproducible using containers.
He is also engaged in the Open Source and Open Science communities and has held workshops on Reproducible Research in [geosciences](https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/repro-papers/), [GIScience](https://o2r.info/reproducible-agile/), and [digital humanities](https://zenodo.org/record/1299031).

Daniel will contribute his technical expertise in reproducible research infrastructure.
