One very effective implementation of a [CODECHECK Process]({{ '/process' | absolute_url }}) are workflows at research performing organisations and academic institutions.
They allow to improve the reproducibility of research outputs in a trusted environment and even before submission to a journal.
This page lists the institutions that have implemented CODECHECK workflows as a service offering for their researchers.

To enhance the reproducibility of scientific publications by TU Delft researchers, the [TU Delft Digital Competence Centre](https://www.tudelft.nl/digital-competence-centre) (DCC) has partnered with the [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/) repository to pilot the offering of CODECHECKs as a service.
Authors who deposit software publications at 4TU.ResearchData are individually invited to have their code CODECHECKed.
In accordance with CODECHECK principles, authors are expected to provide openly available data, a peer-reviewed publication or preprint, and clear instructions for running the code.
Using this information, the DCC conducts the CODECHECK and contacts authors if clarification is needed.
Once the CODECHECK is successfully completed and a certificate is issued, a "Code Works" badge is added to the software publication's landing page at 4TU.ResearchData (see [example](https://doi.org/10.4121/e64c61d3-deb5-4aad-af60-92d92755781f.v3)), along with a link to the associated certificate publication.

## Amsterdam University Medical Centers (Amsterdam UMC)

The Research Data Management (RDM) department of Amsterdam UMC currently offers CODECHECK as a pilot service.
This service focuses on computational workflows in R and/or Python, based on pre-prints or manuscripts ready for submission.
It is available to all research staff from Amsterdam UMC, including PhD candidates. While metadata should be made publicly available, we encourage researchers — in the interest of open science — to also make their data openly accessible whenever possible.
CODECHECK requests can be made via ServiceNow, RDM Research Software Management.
