**CODECHECKing goes NL - strengthening open science through reproducible publications in the Netherlands (CHECK-NL)**

*Dutch research organization NWO funds the project "CodeCHECKing goes NL" <https://www.nwo.nl/projecten/osf232063>: Many research outputs rely on computational methods. Open Science principles ask for those to be shared and to be reproducible. However, in traditional scientific publishing, computational methods are rarely re-run during review. We aim to check the computational workflows of at least 50 scientific articles for reproducibility, and we aim to reach an agreement with journal editors to establish such a check routinely in their review process. To kickstart both, we will organise roadshows at four locations to bring experienced and new code reviewers, authors, and editors together to implement codechecking in a sustainable way.*

**Interested? Reserve 30 May in your agenda, when the first event is going to happen at the TU Delft. More info including how to register found at <https://codecheck.org.uk/nl-workshop1/>. For all questions on the events, send an e-mail to codechecknl@gmail.com . For questions on the project, please contact Frank Ostermann (f.o.ostermann@utwente.nl).
