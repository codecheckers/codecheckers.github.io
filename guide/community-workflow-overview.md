The CODECHECK community workflow described here is the steps that codecheckers follow when conducting **independent CODECHECKs**, i.e., without an active collaboration with a journal or conference.
The community workflow uses free to use infrastructure, in particular the [GitHub organisation codecheckers](https://github.com/codecheckers/) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/codecheck/) for depositing codecheck certificates.
The community workflow is a concrete implementation of the abstract [CODECHECK process](/process) and follows the _[CODECHECK principles](/)_, although it may fall short of Rule 3, because the CODECHECKs are not yet properly registered as peer reviews in open research information databases.

The community workflow documentation is split into three parts:

- [CODECHECK community workflow for authors](/guide/community-workflow-author)
- [CODECHECK community workflow for codecheckers](/guide/community-workflow-codechecker)
  This perspective also has variants: a focused version, a more detailed version, and a version for [in-person workshop with CHECK-NL](/nl/workflow)
- [CODECHECK community workflow for editors](/guide/community-workflow-editor)

## Support

Every CODECHECK is unique, just as the associated research article.
The codechecker can partly rely on the examples below and the [full breadth of CODECHECKs](/register) for good practices and approaches for codechecking.

If you have any questions or concerns, or get stuck, please reach out to fellow codecheckers in the [public CODECHECK discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/codecheckers/discussions) or contact the CODECHECK team (see footer) if you need to consult on sensitive information.

## Examples

See the [CODECHECK register](/register) for a full list of codechecks, including direct links to the reports and register issues.
