CODECHECK is a collaboration project lead by Stephen Eglen and Daniel Nüst together with [a community of codecheckers](/get-involved), collaborators in the scientific, academic publishing, and scholarly infrastructure communities, and a [codecheckers team](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheckers/).

## Team

### Stephen Eglen (PI)

Stephen Eglen is a professor in Computational Neuroscience at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).
He has over 20 years experience as a researcher in Computational Neuroscience, and has worked on several projects encouraging more code and data sharing in Neuroscience.
Most recently this led to a trial project with the journal [Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4579), and our guidelines for sharing in [Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4550).
Stephen is also a fellow of the Alan Turing Institute ([ATI](https://www.turing.ac.uk/)), based in the British Library, and a member of the [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility](https://incf.org) which will provide logistical support e.g. on supercompute infrastructure.

Stephen contributes his domain-specific expertise in computational neuroscience and Open Science.

### Daniel Nüst (Co-PI)

Daniel Nüst is a postdoctoral researcher and research software engineer ith the [Chair of Geoinformatics](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/umwelt/geo/geoinformatik/die-professur?set_language=en), TU Dresden, and at the Institute for Geoinformatics ([ifgi](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/)), University of Münster.
He develops tools for open and reproducible geoscientific research and is a proponent for open scholarship and reproducibility in the projects [NFDI4Earth](https://nfdi4earth.de/), _Opening Reproducible Research_ ([o2r](https://o2r.info)), and [OPTIMETA](https://projects.tib.eu/optimeta).
He is also engaged in the Open Source and Open Science communities and has held workshops on Reproducible Research in [geosciences](https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/repro-papers/), [GIScience](https://o2r.info/reproducible-agile/), and [digital humanities](https://zenodo.org/record/1299031).

Daniel contributes his technical expertise in reproducible research & scholarly communication infrastructures and geospatial data science.

### Codecheckers

The [codecheckers team](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheckers) does the hard work of conducting CODECHECKs.

## Conferences

[![Reproducible AGILE Logo]({{ 'img/reproducible-AGILE-logo-square.svg' | relative_url }}){:width="200"}](https://reproducible-agile.github.io/)

The [Reproducible AGILE initiative](https://reproducible-agile.github.io/) conducts reproducibility reviews [as part of full paper peer review](https://www.agile-giscience-series.net/review_process.html) for the Association of Geographic Information Laboratories in Europe's ([AGILE](https://agile-online.org/)) [annual conference series](https://agile-online.org/conference/).
The reproducibility reviews fulfil the CODECHECK principles and therefore they are listed in the CODECHECK register.
Be sure to check out their [Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CB7Z8).
