CODECHECK is a collaboration project lead by Stephen Eglen and Daniel N√ºst together with [a community of codecheckers](/get-involved), collaborators in the scientific, academic publishing, and scholarly infrastructure communities, and a [codecheckers team](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheckers/).

## Team

### Stephen Eglen (Co-PI)

Stephen Eglen is a professor in Computational Neuroscience at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).
He has over 20 years experience as a researcher in Computational Neuroscience, and has worked on several projects encouraging more code and data sharing in Neuroscience.
Most recently this led to a trial project with the journal [Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4579), and our guidelines for sharing in [Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4550).
Stephen is also a fellow of the Alan Turing Institute ([ATI](https://www.turing.ac.uk/)), based in the British Library, and a member of the [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility](https://incf.org) which will provide logistical support e.g. on supercompute infrastructure.

Stephen contributes his domain-specific expertise in computational neuroscience and Open Science.

### Daniel N√ºst (Co-PI)

Daniel N√ºst is a postdoctoral researcher and research software engineer ith the [Chair of Geoinformatics](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/umwelt/geo/geoinformatik/die-professur?set_language=en), TU Dresden, and at the Institute for Geoinformatics ([ifgi](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/)), University of M√ºnster.
He develops tools for open and reproducible geoscientific research and is a proponent for open scholarship and reproducibility in the projects [NFDI4Earth](https://nfdi4earth.de/), _Opening Reproducible Research_ ([o2r](https://o2r.info)), and [OPTIMETA](https://projects.tib.eu/optimeta).
He is also engaged in the Open Source and Open Science communities and has held workshops on Reproducible Research in [geosciences](https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/repro-papers/), [GIScience](https://o2r.info/reproducible-agile/), and [digital humanities](https://zenodo.org/record/1299031).

Daniel contributes his technical expertise in reproducible research & scholarly communication infrastructures and geospatial data science.

### Frank Ostermann (senior codechecker)

<https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9317-8291> \| <https://www.linkedin.com/pub/frank-ostermann/8/2a7/820>

Frank is an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation ([ITC](https://www.itc.nl/)), [University of Twente](https://people.utwente.nl/f.o.ostermann).
His main research interest is where people, geography, and computer science meet: new modes of production and usage of geographic information (crowdsourced and volunteered), related technological and methodological developments (IoT sensors, machine learning), and the impacts on scientific practice (ethics of consent and privacy-preservation, open and reproducible research).
Citizen Science is where all these elements come together.
Previous work include a PhD from the University of Zurich and (post-doctoral) researcher positions at the Joint Research Center of the European Commission as well as the Universities of Zurich and Hamburg on EU-funded projects.

Frank contributes his experiences in reproducible research as a founding member of [Reproducible AGILE](https://reproducible-agile.github.io/) and his broad topical expertise - he connects CODECHECK with various disciplines and communities.

### Codecheckers

The [codecheckers team](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheckers) does the hard work of conducting CODECHECKs.

The [Reproducible AGILE initiative](https://reproducible-agile.github.io/) conducts reproducibility reviews [as part of full paper peer review](https://www.agile-giscience-series.net/review_process.html) for the Association of Geographic Information Laboratories in Europe's ([AGILE](https://agile-gi.eu/)) [annual conference series](https://agile-gi.eu/conferences/).
The reproducibility reviews fulfil the CODECHECK principles and therefore they are listed in the CODECHECK register.
Be sure to check out their [Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CB7Z8).
