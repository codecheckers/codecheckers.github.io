The [CODECHECK principles](/) can be implemented in different ways.
A generic overview is provided in the [CODECHECK Process]({{ '/process' | absolute_url }}).
This process is realised in workflows listed here:

- The **[CODECHECK community workflow]({{ '/guide/community-workflow-overview' | absolute_url }})**, which is used by the CODECHECK [team]({{ '/partners/#team' | absolute_url }}) to conduct checks for preprints or submitted manuscripts independent from journal collaborations.
- The **[institutional workflows]({{ '/institutions' | absolute_url }})** implemented by CODECHECK partners to conduct checks for members of their institutions.
- The [**Lifecycle Journal**]([https://](https://lifecyclejournal.org/)) uses CODECHECK as one of its [Evaluation Services](https://lifecyclejournal.org/evaluation-services/); the workflow is similar to the community workflow, but an editor from the journal creates the CODECHECK issue in the register.
- [**Reproducible AGILE**](https://agile-gi.eu/activities/reproducible-agile) uses CODECHECK to check the reproducibility of accepted full papers of the AGILE conference series; the reproducibility committee has access to the accepted full papers and conducts CODECHECKs in parallel to the preparation of the camera-ready papers.
