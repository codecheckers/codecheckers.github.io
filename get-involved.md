## As a codechecker

You are a researcher, developer, research software engineer, student, or data/software steward and want to help codechecking submissions?

**Awesome!**
Please open an issue on the [codecheckers](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheckers) repository to be added to the [codecheckers team](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheckers) **[using this link](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheckers/issues/new?assignees=nuest&labels=registration&template=codechecker-registration.md&title=Register+as+codechecker)**.

## As an author

You want to share the code underlying your research paper? **Congratulations** for the decision to practice Open Science and reproducible research!

There are different ways for you to get involved, for example (a) submit a manuscript to a journal conducting CODECHECKs, (b) suggest a CODECHECK as part of your cover letter, or (c) submit your workflow to the [community review process](/guide/community-workflow) right away if you have published a preprint or submit to a journal with an open review.
If you want to reference the CODECHECK project in your manuscript, please use the citation provided at the end of this page.

## As a reviewer or editor

If you are contributing to science as a reviewer of academic manuscripts or as a journal editor, you can initiate a CODECHECK for submitted articles if the author provides suitable information.
The [CODECHECK team](/partners) would be excited to help you start a conversation with your (fellow) journal editors on how you to best achieve that, i.e., if you conduct a [community CODECHECK](/guide/community-workflow), or if you want to set up a proper process at the journal (see below).

## As a journal, publisher, or conference

You are an editor or reviewer at a journal or conference and are interested to introduce a CODECHECK?

**Great!**
There is no formal process or certification.
You can simply announce publicly that you conduct a code review adhereing to the CODECHECK principles, e.g. in a blog post.
A link to the CODECHECK principles in your submission guidelines would probably be helpful for authors and reviewers.
Please consider adding a <img src="/img/codeworks-badge.svg" alt="CODECHECK badge" height="16" style="margin-top: -4px;" /> badge to the publication to highlight the fact that a CODECHECK was conducted.
The badge should link directly to the CODECHECK certificate.

The badge graphic and all documentation on this website are available under open licenses, see [this README](https://github.com/codecheckers/website/blob/master/README.md).

The [CODECHECK team](/partners) would be glad to help you set up a process, if you have any questions - see contacts information below.
We would be happy to list your journal of conference on our website after we have gotten to know your implementation of a CODECHECK process and you have completed your first CODECHECK.

## As a steward or service provider

You are a data steward, a research software steward, or any other non-research staff that helps researchers to create more FAIR and reproducible research contributions?
_Thank you for your service!_
We have several organisations (see [this page with institutional CODECHECK workflows](/institutions/)) that have implemented CODECHECK workflows as a service offering for their researchers and would be happy to share their experiences with you, and learn how we can help to get you started, or how we can help you to improve your existing code checking workflows.

## As a developer or science communicator

CODECHECK is a community effort, and your help is welcome across all tasks that the team faces.
If you want to write code to assisst codecheckers to conduct more effective reviews or to streamline the CODECHECK review processes, or if you want to help presenting and sharing CODECHECK's vision and educate others on code executability checks - then _please get in touch with the [CODECHECK team](/partners/) (see contact details below)_.

## As an event organiser

You would like to (co-)organise a CODECHECK event, such as a workshop or a codechecking exercise, to bring together codecheckers, authors, and editors?
You want to introduce reproducibility checking into your community, maybe expand an existing event or series, such as a conference?
_We got you covered!_
Please check out our [event recipe](/guide/event-recipe) for a detailed guide on how to run a CODECHECK event.
