## As a codechecker

You are a scientist and want to help codechecking submissions?

**Awesome!**
Please open an issue on the [codecheckers](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheckers) repository to be added to the [Codecheckers Team](https://github.com/orgs/codecheckers/teams/codecheckers).

## As a journal, publisher, or conference

You are an editor or reviewer at a journal or conference and are interested to introduce a CODECHECK?

**Great!**
There is no formal process or certification.
You can simply announce publicly that you conduct a code review adhereing to the CODECHECK principles, e.g. in a blog post.
A link to the CODECHECK principles in your submission guidelines would probably be helpful for authors and reviewers.
Please consider adding a <img src="/img/codeworks-badge.svg" alt="CODECHECK badge" height="16" style="margin-top: -4px;" /> badge to the publication to highlight the fact that a CODECHECK was conducted.
The badge should link directly to the CODECHECK report.

The badge graphic and all documentation on this website are available under open licenses, see [this README](https://github.com/codecheckers/website/blob/master/README.md).

The [CODECHECK team](/team) would be glad to help you set up a process, if you have any questions.
We would be happy to list your journal of conference on our website after we have gotten to know your implementation of a CODECHECK process and you have completed your first CODECHECK.
