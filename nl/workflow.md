title: CODECHECK community workflow for CHECK-NL
---

The following steps are required to complete a CODECHECK as part of a workshop organised by [CHECK-NL](/nl/).
See also the [CODECHECK community workflow overview](/guide/community-workflow-overview) for a broader approach.
Before you start, note that every CODECHECK is unique, just as the associated research article.
Reach out to fellow codecheckers in the [public CODECHECK discussion forum](https://github.com/codecheckers/discussion/issues) if you face any problems, or use the [internal team discussion](https://github.com/orgs/codecheckers/teams/codecheckers) if you need to consult in private.
You are probably doing fine even if you digress from this documentation.

## Steps

1. **Authors** create a pre-producible workflow: all data and code, plus a readme file detailing the content, a manifest file detailing the [output CODECHECK configuration file](/spec/config/1.0/), and a license file; this is ideally bundled in a single repository or archive file and accompanied by a (pre-published) paper
1. **Authors** send their request for a CODECHECK to project e-mail address <codechecknl@gmail.com>
1. The **CHECK-NL project team** accepts the request for the workshop or advises to follow the normal community workflow (see above)
1. During the workshop, **codecheckers** download materials or clone the a repository
1. The **codecheckers** create a new directory in their working environment where all new files go, and start documenting the ongoing codecheck; the exact form of codechecking procedure and form of documentation vary greatly, but there are some tools, such as an [R package](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheck) to automate some steps, including a [Rmd template](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheck/tree/master/inst/extdata/templates/codecheck); all of that is optional, as long as the final report contains the mandatory information
1. During codecheck, the **codecheckers** can ask the **authors** (if present at the workshop) in case of encountered problems, keeping in mind the [CODECHECK principles](/project#the-codecheck-principles) (especially “the codechecker records but does not fix” – unless it is a very trivial bug like pathnames)
1. The **codecheckers** summarize the process and outcome in a report - the CODECHECK certificate - and bundle it with all input and output files; this workshop codecheck bundle is then shared with the **CHECK-NL project team** via email or repository; the report should at least contain the information on who checked what and how; document for future self and other researchers; have a look at the available reports; most contain also optional information (compare [CODECHECK community workflow guide](/guide/community-workflow-overview))
1. The **CHECK-NL project team** checks the bundle and report, and together with the workshop codecheckers, revise where necessary; once ready, either the **CHECK-NL project team** or the **codechecker** upload the file on Zenodo or OSF, and [optionally] adds a pull request to original repository for the Codecheck badge
1. The **CHECK-NL project team** project team adds the new codecheck to the registry.
