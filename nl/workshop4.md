On the 14th of February, code-lovers (Valentine's day, after all) from the Digital Humanities came together for our final workshop, hosted at the Leiden University Centre for Digital Humanities. Our day began with an introduction to CODECHECK from our PI, Frank Ostermann, who took participants through the steps involved in the process, and gave them a preview of what they could expect in the second half of the workshop.

After having enjoyed the excellent lunch catering, the participants split into two breakout groups, with each group working on a project to review during the afternoon.We also had two excellent presentations from external speakers: [Hans van Eyghen](https://reproducibilitynetwork.nl/author/hans/) from Tilburg University joined us in person to talk about replication in the humanities, and how it must go beyond code reproducibility. Later, [Ben Marwick](https://faculty.washington.edu/bmarwick/) joined us virtually from the University of Washington in Seattle towards the end of the day to talk about reproducibility practices in Archaeology, and some examples from journals in the field. Both talks sparked interesting and enlightening discussions.

As always, the reflection session with participants helped us understand how they viewed CODECHECK, how it can be rewarded, and what would incentivise them to CODECHECK in the future, or adopt these practices into their own research workflows. To that end, our project will have a final wrap up meeting with key stakeholders in some Dutch institutions, to talk through how we can carry the ideas of CODECHECK forward in the Netherlands, with some interesting initiatives already in the pipeline. Stay tuned for more news and output from us!

## CALL FOR PAPERS/PRE-PRINT/CODE: Contribute to improving reproducibility in the Digital Humanities!

**Are you from the Digital Humanities and interested in reproducible code and open science? We have the perfect opportunity for you!**

As part of our NWO project [CHECK-NL](https://codecheck.org.uk/nl), **we are looking for researchers from the Digital Humanities at a Dutch knowledge or university who would like their papers or projects to be “codechecked” during a live, one-day code-checking workshop on 14 February 2025 at Leiden University**. A [codecheck](https://codecheck.org.uk/process/) is a light-touch independent peer review to check that your code and data can generate the computational results in your paper or project.

You can participate as (a) by submitting your own work to be checked, (b) a codechecker (i.e., a person reviewing code as a participant in the workshop), or (c) both, if you are up for it! Read on to see how…

## How do I submit my code, and what do I get?

- A codechecker will work with you during the session to check whether your code and data can be run by others to generate the same or similar results.
- The codechecker will work with you to resolve any issues found during the code check, and make your code as reproducible as possible!
- Upon completion, your paper will receive a codecheck certificate that confirms your results could be reproduced.  This can be shared, e.g., with potential journal editors, to enhance the visibility and reproducibility of your work.

By participating, you contribute towards making science more open and transparent AND increase the visibility of your own research!

## Sounds good! What should I do?

Are you interested in participating in this event, and contributing to promoting code reproducibility? Send an email to <codechecknl@gmail.com> **by 31 January 2025** with a brief description of your paper/project, and links to your code and data. This could be code related to:

- A paper that you have recently published
- A preprint that is publicly available
- Code and results files that have been or will be deposited in a repository, preferably  GitHub or GitLab

In each case, the code and data underlying the paper should be openly available, or you plan to make them available once the paper is published.

*Selected papers/projects will be notified in early February 2025. All code authors are invited to join the workshop.*

## What if I want to participate as a codechecker instead?

You can register to participate in the workshop on the [registration page](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/events/2025/02/codecheckatlucdh), and join us as a codechecker on 14 February. The event will be held in person in Leiden (see event page for details).

What you can expect during the workshop:

- An introduction to CODECHECK and a live demo
- Beakout groups to CODECHECK a project yourself
- A reflection session to share with us what you thought of CODECHECK and the workshop
- Coffee, lunch, and snacks!

## Why would I volunteer my time to code check other people's work?

- You will learn how others ensure reproducibility of their work (and pick up tips for yourself!)
- You will gain hands-on experience in peer reviewing code
- You will be contributing to more transparent science
