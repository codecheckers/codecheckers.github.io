## CALL FOR PAPERS/PRE-PRINT/CODE: Contribute to improving reproducibility in the Digital Humanities!

**Are you from the Digital Humanities and interested in reproducible code and open science? We have the perfect opportunity for you!**  
 
As part of our NWO project [CHECK-NL](https://codecheck.org.uk/nl), **we are looking for researchers from the Digital Humanities at a Dutch knowledge or university who would like their papers or projects to be “codechecked” during a live, one-day code-checking workshop on 14 February 2025**. A [codecheck](https://codecheck.org.uk/process/) is a light-touch independent peer review to check that your code and data can generate the computational results in your paper or project.  

You can participate as (a) by submitting your own work to be checked, (b) a codechecker (i.e., a person reviewing code as a participant in the workshop), or (c) both, if you are up for it! Read on to see how…  


## How do I submit my code, and what do I get?  
-	A codechecker will work with you during the session to check whether your code and data can be run by others to generate the same or similar results.  
-	The codechecker will work with you to resolve any issues found during the code check, and make your code as reproducible as possible!  
-	Upon completion, your paper will receive a codecheck certificate that confirms your results could be reproduced.  This can be shared, e.g., with potential journal editors, to enhance the visibility and reproducibility of your work.

By participating, you contribute towards making science more open and transparent AND increase the visibility of your own research!  

## Sounds good! What should I do?  

Are you interested in participating in this event, and contributing to promoting code reproducibility? Send an email to codechecknl@gmail.com **by 24 January 2025** with a brief description of your paper/project, and links to your code and data. This could be code related to:  
-	A paper that you have recently published  
-	A preprint that is publicly available  
-	Code and results files that have been or will be deposited in a repository, preferably  GitHub or GitLab 

In each case, the code and data underlying the paper should be openly available, or you plan to make them available once the paper is published. 

*Selected papers/projects will be notified in early February 2025. All code authors are invited to join the workshop.*  

## What if I want to participate as a codechecker instead? 

You can register to participate in the workshop on the [registration page](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/events/2025/02/codecheckatlucdh), and join us as a codechecker on 14 February. The event will be held in person in Leiden (see event page for details).  

What you can expect during the workshop:
- An introduction to CODECHECK and a live demo
- Beakout groups to CODECHECK a project yourself
- A reflection session to share with us what you thought of CODECHECK and the workshop
- Coffee, lunch, and snacks!

## Why would I volunteer my time to code check other people's work? 
-	You will learn how others ensure reproducibility of their work (and pick up tips for yourself!)
-	You will gain hands-on experience in peer reviewing code 
-	You will be contributing to more transparent science
