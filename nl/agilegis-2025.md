## Summary

On **Tuesday, June 10, 2025** the half-day workshop and tutorial "Open and reproducible research best practices: Codechecks, AGILE repro reviews, and reprohacks for your research" will take place in Dresden, Germany, as part of the [AGILE 2025 conference](https://agile-online.org/conference-2025).
The workshop includes hands-on work in small groups to train codecheckers and is a continuation of the close collaboration between the [Reproducible AGILE initiative](https://reproducible-agile.github.io/) and CODECHECK.

The **registration** is now open: <https://agile-gi.eu/conference-2025/fees-2025>

## Abstract

Why would you invest time in checking someone else's code? Because it's fun and you learn a lot!

This event will introduce participants to different communities, processes, and platforms to make their research more open and reproducible.
Then participants will work in pairs to codecheck an existing study or research.
We strongly encourage participants to submit their own work to be checked during the workshop.
However, participating without submitting code is also possible, but basic programming skills in R or Python will come in handy.
There will be several rounds of independent work and feedback, during which participants exchange experience and can ask for help and support.

The last part of the event will be more tips and tricks and a discussion on how and where to continue such activities (e.g., CODECHECK community, ReproHacks, AGILE reproducibility reviews).
In case the submitted code was accompanied by a published (pre-)print, any successful checks will result in feedback on your workflow and a citable CODECHECK certificate!
