## CODECHECKing goes NL - strengthening open science through reproducible publications in the Netherlands (CHECK-NL)

The Dutch research organization *NWO* funds the project [CodeCHECKing goes NL](https://www.nwo.nl/projecten/osf232063).

Many research outputs rely on computational methods.
Open Science principles ask for those methods and data to be shared and to be reproducible.
However, in traditional scientific publishing, computational methods are rarely re-run during review.
[Our project team](#meet-the-project-team) aims to check the computational workflows of at least 50 scientific articles for reproducibility, and we aim to reach an agreement with journal editors to establish such a check routinely in their review process.
To kickstart both, we will organise roadshows at four locations to bring experienced and new code reviewers, authors, and editors together to implement codechecking in a sustainable way.

In addition, the project funds improvements to the CODECHECK infrastructure by adding new features to the [CODECHECK Register](/register/).
You can find all developments within CHECK-NL [in these pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/codecheckers/register/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Acheck-nl+).
Thanks to these contributions by CHECK-NL, you can find all codechecks conducted as part of CHECK-NL in the new community page at <https://codecheck.org.uk/register/venues/communities/codecheck_nl/>.
