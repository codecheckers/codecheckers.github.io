title: CODECHECK connections to Infrastructures for Open Publishing and Open Research Information (CHECK-PUB)
permalink: /pub/

*The Dutch university **TU Delft** funds the project CHECK-PUB to improve codechecking for independent journals based on Open Journal Systems (OJS).*

## Summary

The way that quantitative research is submitted, reviewed, and published today does not adequately handle the reliance on digital workflows using data and software. These shortcomings of scholarly communication platforms and practices hamper the advancement of research because not all parts of research are shared openly and in a readily reusable and effectively findable way. Code execution during peer review has the potential to be a first step to more groundbreaking innovations in scholarly communication.
The CODECHECK initiative has demonstrated how a seemingly low bar - one codechecker is able to successfully execute relevant parts of a computational workflow and reports their findings in a certificate - can drastically improve the level of sharing for data and code, and raise the recognition for diverse research outputs. CODECHECK is seeking collaborations with independent publishing partners to establish code execution workflows. The interests by small independent scholar-led journals often fail due to the scarce resources to manage a further role and task in the submission and review process.

Therefore, in the project CHECK-PUB, we develop an Open Journal Systems (OJS) plugin for CODECHECK to handle the requirements of different variants of codechecking and integrate seamlessly with the CODECHECK infrastructure for publication of certificates and metadata. The CODECHECK OJS Plugin reduces editorial overheads, ensures codechecker recognition, simplifies metadata creation and certificate deposition for codecheckers, and adds procedural flexibility, e.g., by introducing an independent role of codechecker with different anonymity configuration than regular reviewers to facilitate practical code execution.
The CODECHECK OJS Plugin can also act as a bridge for checks conducted outside of OJS-based journals to ensure recognition in public researcher profiles.
Finally, the project will explore an extension to he CODECHECK tools and infrastructure to ensure metadata deposition in platforms for open research information.
